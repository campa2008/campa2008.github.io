Problem Statement:  Most existing reef projects lack continuous, site-specific monitoring systems, leaving managers without the data needed to make timely, informed decisions that could keep reefs healthy.

 Artificial reefs are deployed to restore marine habitats and promote biodiversity, but their success is often uncertain due to changing water quality, pH levels, temperature fluctuations, sedimentation, and human activity. Our project tackles this problem by developing a solar-powered buoy system equipped with sensors and cameras to monitor reef conditions in real time and provide actionable guidance. This system ensures that our artificial reef design not only survives but thrives, supporting long-term ecological stability and biodiversity.
